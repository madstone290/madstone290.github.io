To improve the appearance of links shared from your site to social networks like Twitter and Facebook be sure to configure the following.

Site Twitter usernamePermalink
Twitter username for the site. For pages that have custom author Twitter accounts assigned in their YAML Front Matter or data file, they will be attributed as a creator in the Twitter Card.

For example if my site’s Twitter account is @mmistakes-theme I would add the following to _config.yml

And if I assign @mmistakes as an author account it will appear in the Twitter Card along with @mmistakes-theme, attributed as a creator of the page being shared.

Note: You need to validate cards are working and have Twitter approve Player Cards before they will begin showing up.

Open Graph default imagePermalink
For pages that don’t have a header.image assigned in their YAML Front Matter, site.og_image will be used as a fallback. Use your logo, icon, avatar or something else that is meaningful. Just make sure it is place in the /assets/images/ folder, a minimum size of 120px by 120px, and less than 1MB in file size.
